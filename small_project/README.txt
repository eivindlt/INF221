This project aims to analyze the insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort algorithms.
The src folder contains the jupyter notebook files to:
- Generate testing data. Aka lists for best case, worst case and aveerage case.
- Benchmarking the algorithms. Aka measuring execution times.
- Visualizing the results. Generating plots to include in report.
